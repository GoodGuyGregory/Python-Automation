"Floating By"

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
It's all the same day
I wake up, I go to work
And I try my best to just forget about
Everything that's bringing me down

Waking up, I can't get going
I think I need some help
Need something to get me through
I want to clear my head

Breathe it in and soak it up
I'm finally feeling right
While the world is out there stressing
I'll be floating by

Close my eyes and take a moment
Head up in the clouds
Time stands still, so lost in thought
I'm ten feet off the ground

I wouldn't change a single thing
I know it'll all be fine
While the world is out there stressing
I'll be floating by
