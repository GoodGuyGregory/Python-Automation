**os module commands**

* `os.chdir()`: changes to the directory specified in the string
* `os.getcwd()`: returns the current directory
* `os.listdir()`: returns the contents of the directory you're in
* `os.path.basename()`: returns the basename of the current path passed to it. it's very useful when trying to determine what to name files that could be used for archiving
