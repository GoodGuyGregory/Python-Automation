Ibis Ripley

The Ripley’s been in Ibis’ bloodline for quite some time. 
It was originally conceived some 20 years ago by designer by John Castellano as a full-suspension “softtail.” 
That model year 2001 Ripley featured an aluminum frame with a whopping 32mm (1.25”) of pivotless rear suspension.
My how things have changed. It’s even pretty wild to look back on the brand 10 years ago. 
My first major mountain bike investment involved the then bleeding edge 26″ Mojo HD, which I practically had to sell a kidney 
for back in 2008—the same bike that went on this bikepacking trip before I even had real bags. 
That bike’s long gone, but I’ve been pining for a Ripley for several years now. 
It was re-re-released as a short-travel full-suspension 29er back in 2011. 
Then came the third-generation Ripley LS (2017), which was quite tempting as well. 
But, the latest generation Ripley was the coup de grace for me. 
I had to try it. And try it I did, clocking in about 800 miles on it during rides in my 
local Pisgah playground, a whirlwind mountain bike trip sampling Vermont’s finest singletrack,
and a couple bikepacking trips. Read on for details about what has changed, all the specs, a split-triangle 
frame bag pack list, and my ride impressions.
