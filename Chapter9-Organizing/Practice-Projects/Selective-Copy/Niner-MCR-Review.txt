Niner's MCR

Niner’s full-suspension gravel bike has been in the works for a few years now.
And for the third year in a row, Niner shocked Sea Otter Classic onlookers with their latest prototype.
In 2017 they brought a working alloy test model to show off. Last year, they displayed a 3D-printed proof-of-concept version.
For 2019, the Niner booth featured a complete (and very close to final) model that was arguably the talk of the festival. 
Check out the scrolling gallery below to see Niner’s flipboard presentation that takes you through the company’s thought process, specs,
and details behind the yet-to-be released MCR 9 RDO (Magic Carpet Ride). 
Then, scroll down for a full photo gallery of the bike and a few more details.
