Salsa Deadwood

Normally I try to weave a story into bike reviews in order to keep them interesting,
or at least interesting to write. Each one typically involves some sort of contextual rambling to set the tone for discussing the bike in question. 
However, for this one I am getting straight to the point. 
Even though it may be considered ultra-niche to some, the new Salsa Deadwood SUS is a versatile machine that has people wondering 
just what this bike is all about. So here’s exactly what this bike is, where it came from, who it’s for, and why… 
as well as points about how this bike and it’s components performed on the trail over several hundred miles and a couple months of testing.

(WHAT) THE SALSA DEADWOOD SUS IS NOT.
Released in the 2016 model year lineup, the original Salsa Deadwood was designed for dirt road exploration with a rigid steel frame, drop-handlebars,
and 29+ tires. It looked like the perfect vehicle for scouting a 1,300 mile dirt-centric bikepacking route in East Africa. 
So we set one up and took it to Uganda and Rwanda where it proved its worth in spades. 
I say ‘was’ because the original Deadwood was a one-off creation replaced this year by the latest Fargo, specced with a 27.5+ 
wheel/tire combination but also capable of fitting 29+ hoops.

When the news broke that Salsa nixed the Deadwood from their 
2017 line — even though it technically lived on in new Fargo — folks scratched their heads. 
Not because it was some must-have, do-all bike for the masses, but because it had one of the greatest product names Salsa’s 
marketing team has ever conjured (although the Coen brothers inspired “Fargo” followed by the “Woodchipper” handlebar was pretty damned clever too). 
Fast forward to March of this year in Harrisonburg, VA when Salsa lifted the curtain on Deadwood “the sequel” 
SUS and there was a collective sigh of puzzled relief.
